## Color Scheme

The brand uses a "Luxury Tech Dark Mode" palette:

### Primary — Emerald Tech (AI Core)

- `#008F7A` (primary/500) — The signature brand green. Used for CTAs, accents, interactive elements, and glow effects.
- Full scale: `#e6f5f3` (50) → `#b3e0da` (100) → `#80ccc1` (200) → `#4db8a8` (300) → `#26a894` (400) → `#008F7A` (500) → `#007a69` (600) → `#006557` (700) → `#005046` (800) → `#003b34` (900)

### Secondary — Antique Bronze Gold (Premium Heritage)

- `#B8935A` (secondary/500) — A warm bronze gold that conveys premium heritage and craftsmanship. Used as a complementary accent.
- Full scale: `#f7f3ed` (50) → `#ebe3d3` (100) → `#ddd0b5` (200) → `#cfbd97` (300) → `#c4a878` (400) → `#B8935A` (500) → `#9d7c4a` (600) → `#81653b` (700) → `#654e2d` (800) → `#49381f` (900)

### Backgrounds (Dark Mode)

- `#0B0E0F` — Main background (near-black)
- `#1A1F21` — Card/elevated surface background
- `#242a2d` — Further elevated surfaces
- `#2A3235` — Border color

### Text

- `#F2F4F5` — Primary text (off-white)
- `#8E9DA4` — Muted/secondary text

### Signature Gradient

- Primary-to-secondary gradient (`#008F7A` → `#B8935A`) is used for gradient text treatments on key headlines.

### Glow Effects

- Primary glow: `0 0 20px rgba(0, 143, 122, 0.3)` — Emerald glow on interactive elements
- Gold glow: `0 0 20px rgba(212, 175, 55, 0.3)` — Gold glow for premium accents

## Typography

- **Headings:** Outfit (weight 400–700) — Clean, geometric sans-serif with tight letter-spacing (-0.025em)
- **Body:** DM Sans (weight 400–600) — Warm, readable sans-serif
- **Monospace/Code:** JetBrains Mono (weight 400–500) — For any technical or code-related content
- **Arabic:** Aref Ruqaa (weight 400, 700) — Traditional Arabic serif for cultural heritage elements

## Visual Design Language

- **Dark-first:** All designs should default to the dark palette. Light backgrounds are not part of the brand.
- **Subtle glow & depth:** Use emerald glow effects sparingly to create a tech-forward atmosphere. Cards lift on hover with glow borders.
- **Glass morphism:** Navigation and elevated elements use backdrop blur with semi-transparent dark backgrounds.
- **Geometric patterns:** Subtle grid patterns and floating geometric shapes in the background add texture without distraction.
- **Generous spacing:** Ample whitespace (dark space). The design breathes. Sections use large padding (4rem–8rem vertical).
- **Rounded UI:** Border radii range from 0.25rem (small elements) to 1.5rem (cards/panels) to full pill shapes (buttons).
- **Motion:** Smooth, tasteful animations — elements fade and slide in on scroll. Floating ambient animations for background elements. Nothing abrupt.
- **Iconography:** Line-style icons (Lucide icon set, strokeWidth 1–1.5). Clean, minimal, consistent.

## Do's

- Use the emerald/gold pairing as the primary visual signature
- Keep designs dark, premium, and minimal
- Use the gradient text effect (emerald → gold) for emphasis on key phrases
- Maintain generous spacing and visual hierarchy
- Use subtle glow effects to draw attention to interactive elements
- Respect the dual cultural identity (Arabic heritage + global tech)

## Don'ts

- Don't use light/white backgrounds as primary surfaces
- Don't use bright, saturated, or neon colors outside the defined palette
- Don't overcrowd layouts — space is a design element
- Don't use heavy drop shadows; prefer subtle glows
- Don't use decorative or script fonts outside of the Arabic typeface
- Don't make the design feel like a generic SaaS startup — this is a premium consultancy
